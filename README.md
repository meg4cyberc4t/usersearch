# What are the benefits?

The program itself checks for the presence of the necessary dependencies (in case of their absence, it will be proposed to install them) and the Internet. There is a lock on an inappropriate nickname. The search for social networks is distributed from important (Main) to non-singularly popular (Last). Found active links are written to a file, which can then be read.
